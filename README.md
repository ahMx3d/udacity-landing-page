# Landing Page Project

## Project Details

This solution designed with respect to the ***separation of concerns*** and the **SRP** Principle to meet Udacity's Nanodegree of the professional track's first project *rubric specifications*.

The main scope of this project is to convert a static landing page into a dynamic JS interactive *single page*. This code manipulates the **DOM** elements according to the user's prompt input.

Once clicking on any item in the navbar the page smoothly redirects the user directly to their desired part. Kindly note that the static starter code has been taken from Udacity's [repository](https://github.com/udacity/fend/tree/refresh-2019/projects/landing-page).
